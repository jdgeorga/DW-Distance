# DW-Distance

A tool for comparing atomic structures using the Diffusion Wasserstein Distance.

## Overview

This repository provides a stand-alone code that allows users to:

1. **Create high-dimensional featurizations** of structures. The default method is SOAP, but it is generalizable to any descriptor.
2. **Calculate cost matrices** with various distance metrics and optional exponential Laplacian scaling.
3. **Compute Laplacian matrices** from structures.
4. **Perform optimal transport calculations** using methods like Sinkhorn distance, with options for diffusion Wasserstein distance or traditional Wasserstein distance.
5. **Generate relevant plots** for analysis.
6. **Explore characteristic scenarios** through provided examples.

## Installation
